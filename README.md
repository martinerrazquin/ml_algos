# ML Algorithms

My own implementation of some ML algorithms/models. May be highly inefficient, as some code may be optimized for readibility for educational purposes.

All models should include:
* The source code in a *.py* file
* A notebook showing the code actually works
* A readme companion with some context

## Models currently uploaded

* [Funk-SVD model for recommender systems](funk_svd/)


## Disclaimer

I use this repo issues as sticky notes, please don't take them seriously.
